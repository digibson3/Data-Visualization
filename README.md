# Boulder Dog Trails â€“ Interactive Visualization App

Flask application built to visualize and explore hiking trails in Boulder, Colorado, based on dog accessibility. Using real trail data from Boulderâ€™s open data portal, the app lets users interact with maps and charts to quickly find which trails allow dogs off-leash, which require leashes, and which prohibit dogs altogether.

We built this to combine data cleaning, visualization, and web deployment into one interactive tool thatâ€™s actually useful for locals and visitors with pets.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**  
  Mapbox visualization of trailheads, color-coded by dog policy. Use a dropdown to toggle between off-leash, leash-required, and no-dog trails.

- **Pie Chart Summary**  
  Quickly see what percentage of Boulderâ€™s trails fall under each dog access category.

- **Mileage Distribution**  
  A line chart showing how trail lengths are distributedâ€”most are surprisingly short.


## Tools Used

- **Python (Flask)** â€“ handles routing and data processing  
- **Pandas** â€“ for data cleanup and transformations  
- **Plotly** â€“ used for both the map and interactive charts  
- **HTML/CSS** â€“ simple static front-end rendered with Flask templates  


## File Structure

```
ðŸ“¦ boulder-dog-trails/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html          # Front-end layout with injected charts
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Trails.csv          # Original trails dataset
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ merged_trails.csv   # Cleaned dataset with GPS coordinates
```


## How to Run It Locally

1. Clone this repo and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pandas plotly
   ```

2. Create a folder named `data/` and drop in:
   - `Trails.csv`
   - `merged_trails.csv`

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost:5000`

## Data Prep

The app reads in two datasets:
- One for trail descriptions and dog regulations  
- One merged version that includes GPS coordinates for mapping  

We added a simple categorization function to group trails into:  
- `off_leash`  
- `leash_required`  
- `no_dogs`  

These categories are then used to build visual layers and charts.
